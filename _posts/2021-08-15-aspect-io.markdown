The goal of this post is to evaluate the performance of generating
visualization output for large computations produced by ASPECT. ASPECT
uses deal.II to generate the visualization output. By default we
generate VTU files of the unstructured mesh. Instead of generating one
file per MPI rank, the output can be *grouped* to a specified number
of files (even a single one). These files are written using MPI I/O,
which should allow for fast performance.

# Machine setup and striping

- Computations done on Frontera, nsinker benchmark, adaptive refinement
- /scratch1/ LFS filesystem has 16 OSTs (file servers), up to 60 GB/s
- Striping can be enabled  (-1 = maximum striping) by calling
```
lfs setstripe -c -1 <file or fikder>
```
- default striping is 1 (disabled)

# Results

# Conclusions

This little experiment showed some interesting results:

1.

# Future work

- Compare against HDF5 output.

- Check why striping is slower than writing several files.

- How about 32 files instead of 16?
