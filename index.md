## About

This is the project website for the NSF-sponsored project "[Collaborative
Research: Development and Application of a Framework for Integrated Geodynamic
Earth Models](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925595&HistoricalAwards=false)".

**_Mission:_** To create three-dimensional, integrated geodynamic
reference models for the Earth above the core-mantle boundary, that
can then be used for the accurate forward simulation of the Earth
state on time scales of millions of years.

**_Vision:_** For decades, Earth scientists have dreamed of building
computational simulators that can predict the motion of material
inside and on the surface of Earth on long time scales. To realize
this dream, we need to have an accurate characterization of Earth's
state today, including its temperature state, its chemical
composition, and other quantities such as concentrations of volatiles
and melt fractions as well as grain sizes. None of these quantities
are directly measurable in most of the Earth, but by integrating the
many data sources available today (e.g., from tomography models,
gravity data, MT data, and geochemical information), we can start to
build such a reference model. This project is about exactly this: To
build and disseminate such reference models, use them for
simulations in the mantle convection code
[ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org), and couple them to
simulators of surface processes.
